        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <!-- this whole section is old and needs updating and editing -->
        <p class="lead pt-3">
          If you've made it this far you obviously know my name. I'm Dan. I'm  
          28 years old, I'm a father of two beautiful children and a husband to the most amazing woman I've ever met.
          Growing up, I was always fascinated by tech. I drept of one day becoming a developer. 
          In highschool I decided to take an HTML class that was only a couple of weeks long.
          By the end of the class I decided I wanted to pursue learning more about the development world. 
          However, after a couple of days of googling web development I thought I was never going
          to be mentaly inept enough to ever grasp it. Just like that I let my dream go as fast as it came. 
          I then focused on football and just getting through highschool hoping for a decent scholarship.
          I gave it everything I had. Unfortunately, the scholarship I was working towards never came.
           I got small offers from expensive private colleges that I knew I could never afford. 
          Even with small scholarships I would have student debt that seemed would follow me forever, 
          and I knew that's not what I wanted. So then I did what most small town boys do when they have no real plans for the future.
          I joined the military. I signed on the dotted line Sep 11, 2014 and shipped off for basic training. 
          Without getting into the nitty-gritty, I went from wanting to become a career solder to wanting nothing more 
          than getting out and starting a family. So I went the National Guard route. 
          When I came home I started off doing little jobs here and there, nothing exciting. 
          Living the typical young single guy life. Then I ended up meeting the women that I now get to call my wife and the mother of my two perfect kids. 
          After we got married I finally found a decent paying Job as a delivery driver at UPS. The pay was good, 
          I had great benefits and I was convinced that was my new career. The job was great, but I still felt like something was missing. 
          Like I wasn't living up to my full potential. But I told myself as a non college educated guy, good paying jobs are few and far between. 
          So I continued to grind it out. I remember after my daughter was born, all I wanted was to be there for her. 
          I wanted to be a good dad and husband. I needed to provide for my family no matter the cost. 
          Even if that meant only getting to see my family one or two hours a day because of my commute and long work hours.  
          The longer time went on the more I realized, providing for my family is more than just financial. 
          It's emotional. It's physically being there for my family. I was between a rock and a hard place.
          I knew we needed to make a change, but how? Money is not everything but it's certainly more than nothing. 
          During this time my brother-in-law and one of my best friends had been suggesting that I try out web development. 
          He was and still is a web developer and kept telling me to at least sign up for a couple classes to see if I liked it. 
          Little did he know I've wanted to be in the development field for a long time but I just didn't believe I could do it. 
          So instead of taking his advice I just kept grinding my life away, constantly at odds with myself. 
          Knowing that I needed to do something different but too scared to try. After talking to my wife about wanting to change 
          We decided we were going to completely take charge of our lives and change our circumstances. 
          We decided to sell our house and move across the country. Now brace yourself, this move doesn't make sense to most people. 
          We moved from Colorado to Mississippi. Now mind you, at this point I still haven't given web development a second thought. 
          But for a long list of reasons this move felt right for us.  This brings us to the time I'm writing this bio.    
          It's been almost a year since we moved, and about three months since I decided to pull the trigger on becoming a dev. 
          I love everything about development. Now I'm learning everyday and making up for lost time. My goal is to further my learning so I can exell,
          and land a job as a full time remote dev. They say if you enjoy your work you'll never work a day in your life. 
          So here's to working hard and never working again!</p>
